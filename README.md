# MC-Eternal-Lite-1.12
Repository for the Minecraft Eternal Lite modpack.

If you would like to test the current Beta build and provide feedback/report bugs on it, please do the following:
- Switch to the latest available branch from the Branches dropdown. (Current latest: main).
- Click on the green 'Code' button and click on Download as Zip.
- Extract the contents of the Zip file to a random folder on your computer, and re-zip just the contents of the Client folder.
- Head over to your launcher of choice, and Import the Zip. After doing this, you will have the latest development version of MC Eternal Lite playable.

- For Server files for Beta versions, you will have to process the pack Zip and assemble them yourself.
- MultiMC (https://multimc.org/) is the suggested launcher to process it, as it is very light and simple enough for most server operators to work with.

**WARNING: This version has not been officially released yet for a reason. It's still under development, and will contain bugs. Only use this version if you're interested in testing & reporting issues.**
